# Description:-

This project was generated using Angular version 18.1.1, with the layout styled using Tailwind CSS. It focuses on creating a responsive design for a Recipe Page component. I practiced one-way data binding, using string interpolation for the dish name and dish description and property binding for the dish image. I have also attached live website at the main description of this repository.
